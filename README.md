# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on detecting and classifying plant diseases from leaf images using Deep Learning techniques.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a plant disease dataset to predict whether a plant leaf is healthy or affected by a disease.

The system helps farmers and agricultural experts by enabling early disease detection and improving crop productivity.
